# Tasks API Documentation - ADHD Management Tool

## Overview

This API provides a no-snooze task management system designed specifically for ADHD users. It enforces accountability through strict mode, audit trails, and prevents silent task postponement.

## Key Features

### ðŸ§  ADHD-Focused Design
- **No-Snooze Flow**: Tasks cannot be silently postponed
- **Strict Mode**: Requires reasons for reassignments
- **Audit Trail**: Every action is tracked with timestamps and reasons
- **Accountability**: Coaches can see reassignment patterns

### ðŸ”’ Business Rules
- **Strict Mode**: Cannot reassign without providing a reason
- **Audit Trail**: Every action creates a TaskEvent record
- **Permissions**: Owner/Editor can modify, Viewer is read-only
- **Soft Delete**: Tasks are marked as deleted, not permanently removed

## Models

### Task
- **title**: Task name (required)
- **note**: Additional details (optional)
- **due_at**: Due date/time (required)
- **status**: `pending`, `done`, `deleted`
- **strict_mode**: Boolean (default: true)
- **list_id**: Associated list

### TaskEvent (Audit Trail)
- **task_id**: Associated task
- **user_id**: User who performed the action
- **kind**: `created`, `completed`, `reassigned`, `deleted`
- **reason**: Explanation for the action
- **occurred_at**: Timestamp of the action

## Business Rules & Validation

### Strict Mode Enforcement

- **Strict Mode OFF**: Reassignment can be done without reason
- **Default**: All tasks start in strict mode

### Audit Trail Requirements
- Every action creates a TaskEvent record
- Reasons are required for reassignments in strict mode
- All actions are timestamped
- User who performed the action is tracked

### Permission Rules
- **Owner/Editor**: Can create, update, complete, reassign, delete tasks
- **Viewer**: Can only view tasks
- **Self-accountability**: Users can only modify tasks in lists they have access to

## Error Responses

### 422 Unprocessable Entity - Strict Mode Violation
